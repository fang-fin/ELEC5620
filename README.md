# Web-based LLM Agent Project

This is a web-based Large Language Model (LLM) Agent project, aimed at deploying an intelligent dialogue system from scratch.

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application that combines frontend and backend technologies to create an interactive LLM Agent. The Agent is capable of understanding and responding to user input, performing various tasks, and providing an intelligent conversational experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**:
  - [Go](https://golang.org/) - Primary programming language
  - [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) - Go web framework
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database
  - [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs) - LLM application development framework

- **Frontend**:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Features

- LLM-based intelligent dialogue system
- User-friendly web interface
- Real-time conversation processing
- Persistent data storage
- Extensible Agent capabilities
